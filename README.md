# AI Pull Request Summarizer Demo

This repository showcases how the [AI-PR-Summarizer GitHub Action](https://github.com/behrouz-rad/AI-PR-Summarizer) works in real-world scenarios. The action utilizes AI to automate the process of summarizing and reviewing changes in pull requests (PRs), helping developers write better PR descriptions and ensuring efficient code reviews.

## Overview

The **AI-PR-Summarizer** is designed to streamline the code review process by providing automatic, detailed summaries of the changes made in a PR. This repository demonstrates the action in action, showing how developers can use it to:

- Automatically add summary to the pull request.
- Receive AI-powered summaries and reviews based on custom prompts.
- Reduce manual effort in drafting and reviewing PRs.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Prompts**: You can use your own prompt to tailor the summaries and feedback generated by the AI.
- **Model Flexibility**: Specify which AI models to use by configuring a `models-file`, allowing for tailored results based on your requirements.
- **Caching for Efficiency**: The action includes a versioning system to cache AI models, optimizing performance and reducing redundant fetches.
- **Artifact Uploading**: Optionally upload review artifacts as part of the process for further auditing.

## Files and Their Roles

- `ollama-version.txt`: Any changes to this file invalidate the cache, triggering a fresh install of Ollama.
- `ai-models.txt`: This file lists AI models (one per line) to be used for reviewing. Each model is fetched and cached, and if this file changes, the cache is invalidated, and models are downloaded again. For advanced use, a variety of AI models can be utilized with this action. You can find a complete list of models available for Ollama [here](https://ollama.com/library?sort=popular).
  
- `prompt1.txt`: A customizable prompt that instructs the AI to focus on both summarizing and reviewing the code changes. It offers a balance between providing a high-level summary and conducting a deeper review.
- `prompt2.txt`: An alternative prompt that focuses solely on summarizing the code changes, providing concise, high-level overviews without detailed review feedback.
