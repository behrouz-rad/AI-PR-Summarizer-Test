# AI Pull Request Summarizer Demo

This repository showcases how the [AI-PR-Summarizer GitHub Action](https://github.com/behrouz-rad/AI-PR-Summarizer) works in real-world scenarios. The action utilizes AI to automate the process of summarizing and reviewing changes in pull requests (PRs), helping developers write better PR descriptions and ensuring efficient code reviews.

## Overview

The **AI-PR-Summarizer** is designed to streamline the code review process by providing automatic, detailed summaries of the changes made in a PR. This repository demonstrates the action in action, showing how developers can use it to:

- Automatically add summary to the pull request.
- Receive AI-powered summaries and reviews based on custom prompts.
- Reduce manual effort in drafting and reviewing PRs.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Prompts**: You can use your own prompt to tailor the summaries and feedback generated by the AI.
- **Model Flexibility**: Specify which AI models to use by configuring a `models-file`, allowing for tailored results based on your requirements.
- **Caching for Efficiency**: The action includes a versioning system to cache AI models, optimizing performance and reducing redundant fetches.
- **Artifact Uploading**: Optionally upload review artifacts as part of the process for further auditing.
